	<p>The flood situation in Kerala further worsened with many areas inundated and flight operations suspended till August 18 at Kochi airport. The toll rose to 67 with rain fury claiming 24 lives on August 15 alone. Officials said a red alert has been sounded in all the 14 districts of the State.

	From Kasaragod in the north to Thiruvananthapuram in the south, all rivers are in spate and shutters of 35 dams, including Mullaperiyar, have been opened.

	Eleven deaths were reported from Malappuram alone, officials said.

	Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said said the heavy rains would continue for some more days, which will further worsen the situation. More than 1.5 lakh people have been lodged in relief across the State, he said. A government release said Mr. Vijayan spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Rajnath Singh on the grave situation the State was facing following the rains.</p>

	<p>Kochi Metro will operate services as usual on August 16 despite flooding of the Muttom yard and a few metro station premises, a KMRL spokesperson said.

	“KMRL is closely monitoring the flood situation at Muttom. If the water level continues to go up,  we may be forced to suspend our operations. The source of power is also becoming an issue because Kaloor 110kv substation has been shut down by KSEB at 10.29 p.m. Muttom depot is already surrounded by water and the road access to the depot has been cut off,” KMRL said.

	Meanwhile, train services from Thrissur to Ernakulam have been suspended due to rising water level of Periyar at Aluva bridge. The trains in the opposite direction won't face any problem.</p>
	 
	<p>This year's show highlighted the handiwork of Horace E. Dodge, scion to the auto fortune (his father and his uncle), and in the 1920s and 1930s a boat builder of renown. Horace's “Watercars” were touted as “the world's lowest-priced fine motor boats.” Horace expanded—unprofitably—first in Detroit and then in Newport News, Va., before the family turned off the money tap in 1936. Only a few dozen registered “Dodge Boat” examples remain.</p>
